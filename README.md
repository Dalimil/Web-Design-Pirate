## Motivation & Description
It is hard to look at a website and copy only a small part of it (widget/component/element). We could copy the full HTML and all CSS files and then try to filter out things we don't need, but that would take too much time...

**Web Design Pirate** is a DevTools extension that allows you to select an HTML node, and then gives you only the CSS styles that you need to render the full component. Optionally, for copying wrapper-style components it also allows you to specify the level of inner HTML content that can be thrown away (to further reduce the number of needed CSS styles).

## Examples
For instance I like MDN's header navigation widget. I select it using Developer Tools Inspector, switch to my Web Design Pirate tab, tweak the settings, and finally copy the result.

## Dev
**Pull requests welcome**

Firefox version: APIs used are supported as of Firefox 54. In addition to that, this bug needs to be resolved first: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1300590

### TODO
- For large chunks of HTML (e.g. Expedia html body) it is too slow (devtools freeze) - maybe remove deep level innerHTML already in content scripts (assume user interest in the wrapper element)
- Replace UnCSS online api with a custom offline script using jQuery selectors from parsed CSS AST
